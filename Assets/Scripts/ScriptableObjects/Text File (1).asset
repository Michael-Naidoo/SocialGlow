  opener: 'We need to settle this: What is the most aggressively uncomfortable piece
    of seating ever invented?'
  playerOptions:
  - All chairs are bad, they're unnatural traps for the human spine.
  - That depends entirely on the context. Are we talking about function or material?
  - Clearly, the metal folding chair is the champion of spinal misery.
  response:
  - A bold anti-chair stance! So, you prefer the rugged comfort of the floor?
  - 'A nuanced take! Let''s narrow it down: which one is the most deliberately hostile
    to the sitter?'
  - Ah, a classic choice! But tell me, is the cold of the metal or the pinch of the
    hinge the primary source of its evil?
  PlayerResponsesStrings1:
  - Standing is the only acceptable option. Chairs have ruined productivity for centuries.
  - I think chairs are fine, just overrated. A stool is often more efficient.
  - The floor is terrible. A good chair is a necessity, like a decent water filter.
  PlayerResponsesStrings2:
  - The 'hostile' chair is the one that's too soft, lulling you into a productivity
    coma.
  - "The worst chair is any antique dining chair\u2014they're just glorified wooden
    thrones."
  - The folding chair, no doubt. It embodies impermanence and is architecturally
    painful.
  PlayerResponsesStrings3:
  - The folding chair is a rookie's choice. The true discomfort champion is the beanbag.
  - The plastic patio chair is worse. The little holes leave strange indentations
    on your legs.
  - The folding chair reigns supreme! It's a cruel, unforgiving monument to temporary
    seating.
