  playerOptions:
  - I dont really care for stuff like that.
  - No I havent. What Happened?
  - 'Yea I did. '
  response:
  - I see... Do you just not care or?
  - He was shot giving a speech at UVU.
  - What did you think about it?
  PlayerResponsesStrings1:
  - I just dont care.
  - I mean I do, but not that much.
  - I actually do care, but its triggering so i try to stay away.
  PlayerResponsesStrings2:
  - I see. Why would I care about that?
  - That must have been traumatising for the students.
  - I feel bad for the students, but he had it coming.
  PlayerResponsesStrings3:
  - The shooter needs to get shot, Charlie didnt deserve that.
  - I think that reguardless of the motivs, we cant delve into killing people.
  - He deserved it, but everyone who saw didnt need to se him get shot.
