  opener: Forget the food. Which fast-food mascot is the most culturally dominant
    and therefore the best?
  playerOptions:
  - They're all terrible, low-budget nightmares designed to sell you junk food.
  - How do we define "best"? Is it marketability, design, or sheer creepiness?
  - The King (Burger King) is the clear winner. His silent, unsettling aura is genius.
  response:
  - Harsh! Even the most cynical marketing executive would object. Which one is the
    least effective horror?
  - An excellent question. Let's go with the one who has the most profound, yet deeply
    unnecessary, mythology.
  - The King is a very strong contender! Does his success lie in his unsettling stillness
    or his enormous, vacant head?
  PlayerResponsesStrings1:
  - They should all be canceled. They set a terrible example for children.
  - The mascots are okay, but I prefer the generic, cartoon food items. They're less
    intrusive.
  - Mascots are essential! They bring joy and brand recognition. Don't be such a
    grinch.
  PlayerResponsesStrings2:
  - The ones with too much backstory are the worst. Just let me eat my fries in peace.
  - "The best is the one who is least involved with the food, like the Wendy\u2019s
    girl."
  - The King's mysterious backstory is perfect. He is the perfect blend of royalty
    and menace.
  PlayerResponsesStrings3:
  - The King is a cheap gimmick. Ronald McDonald has a far more iconic and benevolent
    legacy.
  - The Colonel Sanders brand is the best. He's a real person who founded a genuine
    empire.
  - The King is a masterpiece of modern advertising! The unsettling silence perfectly
    encapsulates fast-food existential dread.
