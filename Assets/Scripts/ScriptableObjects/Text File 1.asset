  opener: What do you think about the government's response to the pandemic?
  playerOptions:
  - I don't really have an opinion on it.
  - It was a complete disaster.
  - I think they did their best.
  response:
  - Fair enough. It was a lot to keep track of.
  - That's a strong take. What made you feel it was a disaster?
  - You're more forgiving than some. What do you think they got right?
  PlayerResponsesStrings1:
  - I just don't care.
  - I mean, I do, but not that much.
  - I actually do care, but it's a stressful topic so I try to stay away.
  PlayerResponsesStrings2:
  - The constant rule changes were frustrating.
  - They never should have shut everything down.
  - They didn't act fast enough to stop the spread.
  PlayerResponsesStrings3:
  - They distributed vaccines quickly.
  - They tried to help the economy with stimulus checks.
  - The leaders were just trying to follow the science.
