  opener: 'The most crucial breakfast debate: Is it acceptable for cereal to be soggy,
    or must it remain crunchy to the very end?'
  playerOptions:
  - Cereal itself is a barbaric way to start the day. Why are we even discussing
    this?
  - It really depends on the cereal, doesn't it? Some are built for sogginess.
  - Crunchy or bust! Any hint of sogginess means failure.
  response:
  - A purist, I see! So, you prefer to wrestle with a full English breakfast at dawn,
    then?
  - A pragmatic approach! But which specific cereals, in your expert opinion, have
    mastered the art of the intentional mush?
  - A fellow defender of textural integrity! But at what point does "slightly softened"
    cross the unforgivable line into "disgracefully limp"?
  PlayerResponsesStrings1:
  - Breakfast should be liquid. Solids are too much effort.
  - Cereal has its place, but it's not for breakfast. Maybe a late-night snack.
  - Nonsense! Cereal is the cornerstone of modern society. You just haven't found
    the right bowl.
  PlayerResponsesStrings2:
  - All cereal is a betrayal. It promises crunch but delivers goo.
  - Cornflakes are meant to be eaten fast. But oatmeal is designed for absorption.
  - Crunchy cereal offers a satisfying sensory experience. It's about the journey,
    not just the destination.
  PlayerResponsesStrings3:
  - Soggy cereal is an abomination! It shows a fundamental lack of respect for the
    grain.
  - I don't mind a little sogginess. It allows the flavors to truly meld with the
    milk.
  - The crunch defines the experience! It's the sound of breakfast triumph, the texture
    of ultimate superiority.
