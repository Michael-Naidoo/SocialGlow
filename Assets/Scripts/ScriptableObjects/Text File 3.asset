  opener: How do you feel about the Black Lives Matter movement?
  playerOptions:
  - It's a divisive and harmful movement that has caused a lot of trouble.
  - I've heard different things about it. What's the main point?
  - I fully support the cause and think it's a vital movement.
  response:
  - I've heard people say that. What do you think makes it so divisive?
  - At its core, it's about raising awareness of systemic racism and police brutality.
  - That's great. What part of their message resonates with you most?
  PlayerResponsesStrings1:
  - It's a complete joke. It's just a bunch of people looking for an excuse to riot
    and get a handout.
  - "I feel like it\u2019s been turned into a political weapon. It's not about helping
    people anymore; it's about pushing an agenda."
  - The movement has some good intentions, but some of the followers are just so
    aggressive and angry. They alienate a lot of people who would otherwise support
    the cause.
  PlayerResponsesStrings2:
  - '"Systemic racism" is just a buzzword. It''s a made-up problem to justify why
    some people can''t succeed.'
  - That's one way to see it, I guess. But I think it's more complicated than that,
    and a lot of the stories are exaggerated.
  - Yes, exactly! It's a critical step in bringing these injustices to light so we
    can finally address them.
  PlayerResponsesStrings3:
  - Honestly, I don't know if I agree with any of it. I think it's a dangerous idea
    that's making people hate each other more.
  - I like that it's getting people to talk about uncomfortable issues. The conversation
    is a good first step, even if it's messy.
  - Every part of it resonates with me. The movement is a powerful and necessary
    force for good, and I fully believe in its mission for true equality.
