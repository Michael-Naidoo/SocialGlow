  opener: In the grand tradition of festive cheer, which holiday song genuinely deserves
    to be banished from all radio waves forever?
  playerOptions:
  - All holiday music is a conspiracy designed to numb our brains.
  - It depends on how many times I've heard it. Some are good, until they're not.
  - '"Wonderful Christmastime" by Paul McCartney is a repetitive, synthesized atrocity.'
  response:
  - A Grinchian declaration! But even a Grinch must have a least favorite jingle
    to loathe above all others?
  - Ah, the 'saturation point' theory! Is there one that reaches that point alarmingly
    quickly for you?
  - A bold, yet widely held, opinion! Is it the incessant synth, the nonsensical
    lyrics, or the sheer existence of that specific track that offends you most?
  PlayerResponsesStrings1:
  - The sound of silence is the best holiday music.
  - Some holiday songs are genuinely beautiful. Just not the pop ones.
  - Music is the soul of the season! You just need better taste.
  PlayerResponsesStrings2:
  - The corporate jingles are the worst. They're not even real songs.
  - '"Last Christmas" gets old fast. It''s just so whiny after the 50th listen.'
  - The repetitive nature of some songs is part of their charm. They evoke nostalgia.
  PlayerResponsesStrings3:
  - Any song that mentions snow when you live somewhere hot is an insult.
  - '"All I Want For Christmas Is You" is catchy, but it''s on a loop from November.'
  - Yes! "Wonderful Christmastime" is a monument to a bad idea. It's aggressively
    bad.
