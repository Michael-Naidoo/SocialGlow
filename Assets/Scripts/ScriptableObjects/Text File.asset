  opener: Have you heard about the January 6th Capitol attack?
  playerOptions:
  - I don't really care for stuff like that.
  - No, I haven't. What happened?
  - Yeah, I did.
  response:
  - Oh, okay. I get it. Some topics are just too much.
  - It was when a large mob broke into the U.S. Capitol building. It was a pretty
    wild scene.
  - So you know. What did you think about the people involved?
  PlayerResponsesStrings1:
  - I just don't care.
  - I mean, I do, but not that much.
  - "I actually do care, but it\u2019s triggering so I try to stay away."
  PlayerResponsesStrings2:
  - So, they just broke in? Why?
  - Was anyone hurt?
  - That must have been terrifying for the people inside.
  PlayerResponsesStrings3:
  - 'I think they should be punished.  '
  - 'It was a chaotic situation that got out of hand.  '
  - I think they were right to protest.
