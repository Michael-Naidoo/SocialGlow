  opener: 'The greatest debate of our time: Is blue or red fundamentally the superior
    color?'
  playerOptions:
  - It's a stupid argument. Neither color is any good; they're both too basic.
  - "That\u2019s an odd thing to debate. What makes one \"superior\" to the other?"
  - Obviously, red is the superior color, the one true champion of the spectrum.
  response:
  - Oh, a color nihilist! What colors, then, do you deem worthy of existence?
  - It's about fundamental aesthetic superiority, of course. For instance, which
    one holds more historical weight?
  - A person of culture, I see! But why do you feel that red dominates the entire
    visible light spectrum?
  PlayerResponsesStrings1:
  - Any color is better than those two overrated hues. They just scream 'corporate
    logo.'
  - I don't think any colors are 'bad,' but I prefer greens and yellows for the vibes.
  - "Blue is the true king! Red is only popular because it\u2019s a cheap attention-grabber."
  PlayerResponsesStrings2:
  - The concept of 'historical weight' is meaningless. They're just wavelengths of
    light.
  - Is it about psychology then? Doesn't blue imply calm, and red imply danger?
  - Red is clearly the color of passion and power. It's inherently more significant
    than blue.
  PlayerResponsesStrings3:
  - Red is actually quite vulgar. It's loud, angry, and has very poor emotional depth.
  - I like red, but isn't blue more popular in the corporate world? That must count
    for something.
  - Red is the color of fire, love, and stop signs! It literally dictates human action.
    It is supreme.
